    The last column of GTF has a variable number of key value pairs

    Parse these into a dictionary mapping each key onto a list of values,

    Parameters
    ----------
    attribute_strings : list of str

    quote_char : str
        Quote character to remove from values

    missing_value : any
        If an attribute is missing from a row, give it this value.

    usecols : list of str or None
        If not None, then only expand columns included in this set,

    Returns OrderedDict of column->value list mappings, in the order they

    # SOME NOTES ABOUT THE BIZARRE STRING INTERNING GOING ON BELOW
    #
    # While parsing millions of repeated strings (e.g. "gene_id" and "TP53"),
    # we can save a lot of memory by making sure there's only one string
    # object per unique string. The canonical way to do this is using
    # the 'intern' function. One problem is that Py2 won't let you intern
    # unicode objects, so to get around this we call intern(str(...)).
    #
    # It also turns out to be faster to check interned strings ourselves
    # using a local dictionary, hence the two dictionaries below
    # and pair of try/except blocks in the loop.
