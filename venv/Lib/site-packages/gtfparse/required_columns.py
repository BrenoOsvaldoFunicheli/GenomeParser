Columns of a GTF file:

    seqname   - name of the chromosome or scaffold; chromosome names
                without a 'chr' in Ensembl (but sometimes with a 'chr'
                elsewhere)
    source    - name of the program that generated this feature, or
                the data source (database or project name)
    feature   - feature type name.
                Features currently in Ensembl GTFs:
                    gene
                    transcript
                    exon
                    CDS
                    Selenocysteine
                    start_codon
                    stop_codon
                    UTR
                Older Ensembl releases may be missing some of these features.
    start     - start position of the feature, with sequence numbering
                starting at 1.
    end       - end position of the feature, with sequence numbering
                starting at 1.
    score     - a floating point value indiciating the score of a feature
    strand    - defined as + (forward) or - (reverse).
    frame     - one of '0', '1' or '2'. Frame indicates the number of base pairs
                before you encounter a full codon. '0' indicates the feature
                begins with a whole codon. '1' indicates there is an extra
                base (the 3rd base of the prior codon) at the start of this feature.
                '2' indicates there are two extra bases (2nd and 3rd base of the
                prior exon) before the first codon. All values are given with
                relation to the 5' end.
    attribute - a semicolon-separated list of tag-value pairs (separated by a space),
                providing additional information about each feature. A key can be
                repeated multiple times.
